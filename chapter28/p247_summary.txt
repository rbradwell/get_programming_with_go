errors are values that interoperate with multiple return values and the rest of the GO language
there is a great deal of flexibility in handling errors if you are willing to get creative
custom error types are possible by satisfying the error interface
the defer keyword helps clean up before a function returns
type assertions can convert an interface to a concrete type or another interface
don't panic - return an error instead
