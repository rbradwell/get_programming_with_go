Go has multiple return values.
This provides a simple and consistent mechanism to errors to calling functions.
If a function can return an error by convention it will use the last return value to do so.
The caller should check if an error occurred immediately after calling the function.
If an error occurs the err variable won't be nil, causing the program to print the error and exit immediately.
The nonzero value passed to the os.Exit informs the operating system that an error occurred.
