pointers store memory addresses.
the address operator (&) provides the memory address of a variable
a pointer can be dereferenced (&) to access or modify the value it points to
pointers are types declared with a preceeding asterisk, such as *int
use pointers to mutate values across function and method boundaries
pointers are most useful with structures and arrays
maps and slices use pointers behind the scenes
interior pointers can point at fields inside structures without declaring those fields as pointers
use pointers when it makes sense but dont overuse.
