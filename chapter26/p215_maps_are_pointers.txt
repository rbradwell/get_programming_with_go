/*
Not all mutations require explicit use of a pointer.
Go uses pointers behind the scenes for some of the built-in collections

a previous lesson highlighted that maps aren't copied when assigned or passed as arguments.
Maps are pointers in disguise, so pointing to a map is redundant. i.e. don't do this

func demolish(planets *map[string]string)

it's perfectly fine for the key or value of a map to be a pointer type, but there's rarely any reason to point to a map.
